# Roleplay

This is a game currently being made by myself and a friend.  It will be text-based and written in python.
Eventually we hope to use blender, unity, and c# to make our game come to life in a 3D environment.

I can now convert the python file into an exe
so you can run it on your laptop without any problems

This is the github page.  if you want to view the code for the current version then click on the `.py` file.  If you want to check out current todos, bugs, or problems I am having with the text-based version then click on the `issues` tab.  If you want to check out the ideas that we have currently then you can click on the `Ideas.txt` file.  If you want to edit any of the files then you can do so and send me a pull request and we can talk about the update.  Also, you can submit sketches and such to here so we can keep an idea going of the general direction of the graphic version of our game.  :smiley:
